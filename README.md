# London to Madrid
Exploring flight prices and building models to predict them

---

I am currently living in London, but I am constantly trying to visit Madrid to see my friends and family. Whenever I am looking to book a flight to go back home, I am always faced with the same questions:
1. How much is it going to cost me? How much should it cost me?
2. When is the right time to book a flight? When is the best time to fly?
3. From where should I fly? Which airport combination is the best?
4. Is it possible to predict the prices?

The aim of this project is to solve these questions, using the scraped data from flight aggregators such as Adioso.

Questions 1 to 3 can be answered by performing exploratory data analysis, using GroupBy functions as queries, or visualisation software Tableau.

Question 4 on the other hand is a Machine Learning problem, which will be answered by using simple regression models such as Linear, Ridge and Lasso.
